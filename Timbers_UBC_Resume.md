**TEACHING EXPERIENCE:**

**1. *Instructor*,** Quest University, Squamish, BC, October 27-November
19, 2015

PHY3009 – Computation in the Physical Sciences (for BA&Sc - 13 students)
Critical practices to carry out a computational project from beginning
to end, including code modularization, readability and re-use, as well
as version control to organize their coding projects and collaborate
effectively. Ultimately, students will use these tools to analyze their
own datasets in a term project. For preparation, students will work
through a sample dataset from a radioactive isotope decay experiment
together as a class. Skills will be taught via a combination of
live-coding sessions and work-along sessions. Think of it as a guided
three hour hackathon each day of the block.

**2. *Instructor & Mentorship Sub-committee member*,** Software
Carpentry, March, 2015 – Present\
http://software-carpentry.org\
\
The Software Carpentry Foundation is a non-profit organization whose
instructors teach scientists and researchers basic software skills.
Workshops cover the basics of automating tasks using the Unix shell,
structured programming in Python or R, version control using Git and
relational databases and SQL.

**3. *Instructor*,** Michigan State University, Kellogg Biological
Station, Augusta, MI, August 24-28, 2015

Advanced Analysis of Next-Generation Sequencing Data – Intensive one
week summer course will introduce attendees with a strong biology
background and an intermediate computational background to doing
reproducible research using Docker, AWS Cloud Computing, version control
with Git/Github and RMarkdown, as well as how to perform genome
assembly, differential expression analysis, genome-wide association
analysis, and RNAseq pathway analysis.

**4. *Instructor*,** University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC,
January – April, 2011\
\
PSYC 306 – Principles of Animal Behavior (for B.Sc. Psychology Majors -
approx. 100 students). Theory of evolution; behavioral genetics; social
systems as ecological adaptation; mating and parental strategies;
instinct and learning; evolution of human behavior.

**5.** ***Teaching Assistant***, Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods
Hole, MA , July 2008\
\
Neural Systems and Behavior (graduate level course - approx. 25
students). I was the teaching assistant for 2 weeks of an intensive
8-week laboratory and lecture course focusing on the neural basis of
behavior, including the cellular and synaptic levels, sensory and motor
systems, neurogenetics, and the analysis of complex systems. Intended
for graduate students, postdoctoral students, and independent
investigators who wish to gain a broad perspective on neural systems and
how they produce behavior.

**6. *Teaching Assistant***, University of British Columbia, Vancouver,
BC, 2006 – 2011\
\
PSYC 306 – Principles of Animal Behavior, PSYC 363 *–* Principles of
Animal Learning and PSYC 368 *–* Perceptual Processing

**7. *Teaching Assistant***, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, January –
April, 2005\
\
BIOL 3802 – Animal Behavior

**SUPERVISORY EXPERIENCE:**

During my doctoral and postdoctoral training I have supervised 15
undergraduate student projects that ranged from short (2-3 months)
volunteer projects to year-long undergraduate theses and co-op projects.
I have been responsible for planning projects, training students,
holding regular progress report meetings with students, and grading. I
have learned to alter my supervisory style to best suit the learning
style of each student, to give positive but constructive feedback, and
to design projects that are appropriate for the student’s skill level
and project timeline. Many of the students I supervised have been
successful at obtaining further opportunities to accelerate their
careers following their work with me. The first student I supervised,
Arya Mehran, is now a Ph.D. candidate at UBC studying molecular
signalling. A co-op student, Jing (Morgana) Xu, is now a Master’s
student at the BC Cancer Agency. Mavis Chan is now engaged in a Medical
Laboratory Science Advanced Diploma Program at the Michener Institute.
Kirsten Lee is now attending Dentistry School at Western University.
Joshua Lai is now in Medical School at UBC where he hopes to complete an
M.D.-Ph.D.
