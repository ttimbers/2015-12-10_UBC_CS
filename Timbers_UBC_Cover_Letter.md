Dear Computer Science Search Committee,

I am writing to apply for the Tenure Track Teaching Position in the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. I am a Banting Postdoctoral Fellow at Simon Fraser University and my research background is in the area of Life Sciences, specifically I use a combination of wet-lab and computational methods to investigate the molecular underpinnings of cilia, cellular organelles that act as a locus of sensory transduction, and how they relate to common human diseases, such as blindness and kidney disease. I am a passionate teacher with over 10 years of teaching experience which spans semester-long undergraduate classes, one-on-one mentorship in the lab, hands on 2 day computer programming workshops, and innovative and week-longintensive practical wet-lab and computation classes. 

The Tenure Track Teaching position in the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia really excites me for two reasons, first, having profited from close interactions with faculty as an undergraduate at Carleton University, my ultimate career goal is to teach and develop curriculum to enhance the training of future researchers. Second, at the graduate and postdoctoral levels, I have observed a disturbing under-training of quantitative and computational skills from researchers across all disciplines. This problem has far-reaching consequences in research and may be a major cause of the current reproducibility crisis. I strongly feel that students should be trained in practical quantitative and computational research skills and that this training should begin at the undergraduate level. Thus, I am very excited of the prospect of working with UBC to further the training of undergraduates in computer science.

Although my science background is in the Life Sciences, I have a passion and a great interest in all aspects of quantitative and computational sciences. My recent postdoctoral research involves collecting and integrating two large datasets; whole-genome-sequence information with quantitative animal behaviour data collected using an automated computer vision system. This work has forced me to tackle many practical aspects to working in the quantitative sciences, including: data acquisition and management, analyzing, visualizing and performing statistics on large heterogenous datasets with a programming language (e.g., Python or R), and disseminating quantitative information to both specialized and general audiences. In addition to using these skills in my research on a daily basis, I have experience teaching all of these topics via live-coding and interactive problem solving sessions as a visiting tutor at Quest University teaching Computation in the Physical Sciences  (http://phy3009.github.io/PHY3009-2015/), a volunteer Instructor and Mentor for Software Carpentry  (http://software-carpentry.org/) and through the Scientific Programming Study group that I established this year at Simon Fraser University (http://sciprog.ca/).

Thank-you for taking the time to review my application and considering me for the Tenure Track Teaching Position in the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. Included in this packet, please find my Resume, Teaching Statement and Evidence of Teaching Effectiveness Statement.

Sincerely, 

Tiffany A. Timbers, Ph.D.
